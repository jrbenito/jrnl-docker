# jrnl as container

This allows jrnl to run as a container, anywhere. Journal files could be stored in the cloud (dropbox)

## Build

docker build -t jrbenito/jrnl .

## Usage

`docker run -it --rm -v /path/to/journals/and/config:/jrnlfiles jrbenito/jrnl`

This will run jrnl container, first time you will be prompted to configure your firs journal, pass `/jrnlfiles/journal.txt` as the location.

`docker run -it --rm -v /path/to/journals/and/config:/jrnlfiles jrbenito/jrnl something to log in my journal`

This will add "something to log in my journal" to your default journal

`docker run -it --rm -v /path/to/journals/and/config:/jrnlfiles --entrypoint /bin/bash jrbenito/jrnl`

This will run a bash shell inside the container.

All journal times are logged in UTC timezone. To change that:

`docker run -it --rm -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro -v /path/to/journals/and/config:/jrnlfiles jrbenito/jrnl`

This way your journal will have localtime.

## Suggestion

Make a alias for your bash shell:

`alias jrnl = docker run -it --rm -v /path/to/journals/and/config:/jrnlfiles jrbenito/jrnl`

Now you can do just:

`jrnl another thing I want to say`
